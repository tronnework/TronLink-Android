            V. Risk reminders
            </h2>
            <p>
            5.1 You understand and acknowledge that digital tokens may entail substantial risks such as technical instability or being non-cashable due to inadequate laws and regulations in this respect. You also understand that the volatility of digital tokens is much higher than those of other financial assets. You are advised to choose to hold or dispose of any digital tokens in a rational manner based on your financial status and risk appetite. You also understand that TronLink's Markets feature only captures search results on the exchange rates of digital tokens from selected exchanges and does not represent the latest quote or best offer.            </p>
            <p>
            5.2 If you or your counterparty fails to comply with the operating instructions and rules specified in this Agreement or those described on the website, transaction, and payment pages when using the TronLink Service, the Company does not guarantee successful execution of the transaction and will not be liable for any damages incurred. If the foregoing occurs and the funds are credited beforehand to your or your counterparty's TronLink wallet or a third party's wallet, you understand that operations on blockchain are "irreversible" and that the relevant transaction is "irrevocable", and that you and your counterparty shall bear the consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
            5.3 You understand and acknowledge that swaps and spot transactions are both initiated, executed, and completed on a third-party smart contract. TronLink serves only as an interface tool to help users interact with the third-party smart contract and display the corresponding results of completed transactions.            </p>
            <p>
            5.4 When accessing third-party services through TronLink, the Company strongly recommends that you carefully read the User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and other relevant documents and information on such third-party services, understand the other party of the transaction and the product, and carefully assess the risks involved before making transactions on such third parties. You understand that the transaction and the contractual relationship established is between you and your counterparty and does not concern the Company. The Company is not liable for any risks, liabilities, losses or expenses arising out of your trading.
            </p>
            <p>
            5.5 When transferring your digital tokens to another wallet address, you shall determine for yourself whether the other party is a person of full civil capacity during the transaction and decide for yourself whether to make a transaction with or transfer money to the other party, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
            5.6 When seeing abnormal information such as "transaction failed" or "block production timeout" during fund transfers, you shall double confirm through the official channels of the blockchain or other blockchain query tools to avoid repeated transfers; otherwise, all losses and expenses incurred shall be borne by you.
            </p>
            <p>
            5.7 You understand that after creating or importing a wallet on TronLink, your Keystore, private key, mnemonics, and other information are stored only on the mobile device you are using rather than on TronLink's or the Company's servers. You may follow the instructions provided by TronLink to change the mobile device by syncing your wallet, etc. Nevertheless, in cases where your mobile device is missing, which incurs losses of digital tokens because you have not saved or backed up your wallet password, private key, mnemonics, Keystore or other information, the Company will not be able to retrieve them for you. In cases where digital tokens are lost due to disclosure of information when you export, save or back up your wallet password, private key, mnemonics, Keystore or other information, or the fact that the device or server used to save or back up the above information is attacked or controlled by a hacker, the Company will not be able to retrieve them for you. Any and all damages arising out of the foregoing shall be borne by you.
